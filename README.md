# hand_written_digit_recognition

In this repository you will find the source code for my first neural network implementation. I have commented and added markdown for all source code the jupyter notebook.
This model was able to identify hand written digits with 94.9% accuracy. I plan to work on experimenting with new models to increase this percentage closer to the 98-99% mark.
